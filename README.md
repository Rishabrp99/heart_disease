# Predictiing heard disease using SVM classifier
Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Today, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide with 17.9 million deaths annually, as per the World Health Organization reports [1]. Various unhealthy  activities are the reason for the increase in the risk of heart disease like high cholesterol, obesity, increase in triglycerides levels, hypertension, etc.  ere are certain signs which the American Heart Association  lists like the persons havingsleep issues, a certain increase and decrease in heart rate (irregular heartbeat), swollen legs, and in some cases weight gain occurring quite fast; it can be 1-2 kg daily. In machine learning, support-vector machines are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis.
